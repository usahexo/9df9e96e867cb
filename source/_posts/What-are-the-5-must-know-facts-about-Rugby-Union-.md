#  How did Rugby Union originate? 

Rugby union is a sport that has been around for centuries, and its exact origins are a little murky. However, there are some popular theories about how Rugby Union originated. 

One theory is that Rugby Union began as a game called “mob football”. This game was played in England in the 12th and 13th centuries, and involved two teams of people attempting to move a ball to a predetermined location. The only rule was that no player could carry the ball for more than four steps. 

Another theory is that Rugby Union originated from the game of “calcio fiorentino”, which was played in Italy in the 16th century. This game was similar to Rugby Union in that players were not allowed to run with the ball, and they could only pass it sideways or backwards. 

Whichever theory is correct, it is clear that Rugby Union has been around for centuries and has evolved into the popular sport that it is today.

#  What are the basic rules of Rugby Union? 
Rugby Union is a physical sport that has many basic rules. The aim of the game is to score more points than the opposing team by carrying, passing, or kicking the ball towards the opponents' goal line. 

Players can only handle the ball once before passing it on, and must not run with it. They can kick or punch the ball forward but must not hold onto it for more than three steps. 

The game is played over two 40-minute halves, with a break in the middle. Teams are made up of 15 players, of which 7 can be on the pitch at any one time. 

The ball can be advanced by running with it, kicking it, or throwing it forwards – but players cannot pass backwards. If a player does miscontrol the ball and it goes out of bounds, a scrum is formed where the ball went out. 

Scrums are also used to restart play after minor infringements such as knocking on or handling in a maul. In a scrum, 8 players from each team bind together with their heads down and push forward until one side wins possession of the ball. 

Players can be tackled if they have hold of the ball, or if they are in possession of it when they are tackled. A player who is tackled must release the ball immediately and cannot tackle or interfere with an opponent until they have done so. Play continues until a try is scored, a player is sent off or touch judge signals an end to play. 

Rugby Union is a physically demanding sport that has been around for centuries. The basic rules are easy to learn but mastering the game takes years of practice. If you’re interested in giving Rugby Union a go, your best bet is to find a local club and get started!

#  What are some of the more commonly used terms in Rugby Union? 

Rugby Union is a complex sport with its own language. Here are some of the more commonly used terms: 

- Try: A try is the main scoring method in rugby union, worth 5 points. To score a try, a player must ground the ball in the in-goal area between the two goal posts. 
- Conversion: After scoring a try, a player has the opportunity to add an extra 2 points to their team’s total by kicking the ball through the posts. This is called a conversion. 
- Penalty goal: A penalty goal is awarded to a team when their opponent commits a penal offence. The player can either kick the ball over the bar and between the two posts for 3 points, or they can tap it over and run it for 4 points. 
- Drop goal: A drop goal is scored by dropping the ball on to the ground and kicking it over the bar and between the two posts for 3 points. 
- Maul: A maul occurs when at least 3 players from each team are bound together and driving forward. 
- Ruck: A ruck forms when one or more players from each team are in physical contact with each other and on their feet, over possession of the ball which is on or close to the ground.
